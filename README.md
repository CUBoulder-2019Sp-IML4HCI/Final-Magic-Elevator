## The Idea
Elevators are both a blessing and a curse. They enable heavy equipment to be transported across levels, and they are often the only means by which people with mobility impairments can move up and down in a building. However, waiting for them in an awkward silence is anything but exciting. The Magic Elevator solves this problem: riders become witches and wizards, summoning their elevator through magic spells. Only a correctly executed spell calls the elevator!

This report describes a minimum viable product (MVP) prototype of a system that accomplishes this idea. The prototype was built by Maximilian Funck and Shawn Polson as part of their Machine Learning for Human-Computer Interaction course (CSCI 5880) at CU Boulder. Witches/wizards wield magic wands that are plastic toy Harry Potter wands whose insides were gutted and replaced with a micro:bit that senses X, Y, and Z acceleration. They perform wand motions with voice incantations that together call the elevator either up or down. The witches/wizards come up with and train the motions and incantations themselves through the Magic Elevator's user interface (UI). When spells are cast correctly, a button-pushing mechanism built almost entirely out of LEGO parts (and a Raspberry Pi 3), which is mounted over the elevator buttons, summons the elevator in the appropriate direction.

Witches/wizards are free to train a new wand motion or set a new incantation for their spells at any time; Professor Flitwick walks them through it in the UI. When two users are present, they must work together to cast agreeing spells to call the elevator in one direction. It's a game; only sufficiently skilled witches/wizards may enter the Magic Elevator! When only one is present, she or he can just call the elevator in single-player mode.

## Mission Statement
Our mission is to provide a Harry Potter–like elevator experience with machine learning technology. The interaction with the input device, a wand, results in a magically activated elevator terminal pressing the buttons to call the elevator. The user experience is designed to be seamless and intuitive, just like magic.

## Building the Project
This repo contains all the software needed to recreate the Magic Elevator. The hardware—wands and the mechanical button pusher—were custom-built, and recreating them isn't trivial. But here we include details for building all aspects of our system.
