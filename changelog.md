## [0.0.1] – 2019-03-12
### Added
 - Max reset the software in the Raspberry Pi, wired the Pi back into our 3D-printed housing, and reconnected it to our solenoids.
 - Max got Zerotier connectivity working between the Raspberry Pi and both his and Shawn's laptops.
 - Both Max and Shawn can now remotely connect to and control the Raspberry Pi from their laptops.
 - Max confirmed that simple classification OSC messages from Wekinator can be recieved by the Raspberry Pi.
 
## [0.0.2] – 2019-03-15
### Added
 - Shawn rewrote the Processing code on the Raspberry Pi to accept DTW wand gestures from Wekinator, as opposed to simple classification OSC messages.
 - Shawn created, trained, and saved a Wekinator project that reliably recognizes "up" and "down" spells from a wand. 
 - Shawn confirmed that wand spells can in fact cause our solenoids to fire.
 
## [0.0.3] – 2019-03-19
### Added
 - Both Max and Shawn tested our solenoid system on the elevator in Atlas, and all the components work with one another, but the solenoids just are not powerful enough to actually press the elevator buttons!
 - Shawn uploaded all relevant code files to GitHub and created this changelog file.
 - Both Max and Shawn recorded this progress update video: (TDB)
